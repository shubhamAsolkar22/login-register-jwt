# LoginRegisterJwt

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.
## Concepts learnt from this project

[Local storage: One of the best ways to store data. Local storage is not vulnerable to CSRF attacks.](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/best-practices-for-jwt-authentication-in-angular-apps.aspx)

For additional security, we must consider a few more things on the server side, such as:

* Token expiration validation.
* Content security policy.
* Refresh token mechanism.
* Anti-forgery token mechanism.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
